bladesofgreens.com is a website designed using Shopify's e-commerce platform.  The owner of the website wanted to a streamlined, easy to use (for both himself and the prospective customer) website that was easy enough for a 50 something retiree to navigate.  Shopify and the range of tools provided by the company allowed for us to construct an easy to use webstore that allows for customers to purchase astro-turf while learning a bit about the company and the services offered.  Developing the look for the site was easy enough in the beginning: select a theme, add some images and your off and running.  The fun of customizing the site comes once you download Shopify's Theme Kit Editor.

The backend of the app was built using node and express to connect to a mySQL database, this database was created to capture orders and customer information.  In order to create the necessary connections a number of dependencies needed to be implemented. The backend also makes use of the Yarn package manager (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) which can also be installed using home brew making use of the command "brew install yarn".  Ngrok (http://subdomain.ngrok.com) was also used to create a tunnel for webhook testing.  Ngrok creates a tunnel from the public internet to a port on your local machine. You can give this URL to anyone to allow them to try out a web site you're developing without doing any deployment.
